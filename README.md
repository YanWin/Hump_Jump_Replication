*Auclert, Adrien, Matthew Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub. Micro jumps, macro humps: Monetary policy and business cycles in an estimated HANK model. No. w26647. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2020.

The work so far is summarized in the HANKnoSticky.ipynb where I run the model and plot things like the consumption function and IRFs.
